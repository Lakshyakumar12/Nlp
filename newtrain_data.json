        "src": "\" There is an old legend that king Midas for a long time hunted the wise Silenus , the companion of Dionysus , in the forests , without catching him . When Silenus finally fell into the king ’s hands , the king asked what was the best thing of all for men , the very finest . The daemon remained silent , motionless and inflexible , until , compelled by the king , he finally broke out into shrill laughter and said these words , “ Suffering creature , born for a day , child of accident and toil , why are you forcing me to say what would give you the greatest pleasure not to hear ? The very best thing for you is totally unreachable : not to have been born , not to exist , to be nothing . The second best thing for you , however , is this — to die soon . ” What is the relationship between the Olympian world of the gods and this popular wisdom ? It is like the relationship of the entrancing vision of the tortured martyr to his torments . Now , as it were , the Olympic magic mountain reveals itself and shows us its roots . The Greek knew and felt the terror and horrors of existence : in order to be able to live at all , he must have placed in front of him the gleaming dream birth of the Olympians ... In this way , the gods justify the lives of men , because they themselves live it — that is the only satisfactory theodicy ! Existence under the bright sunshine of such gods is experienced as worth striving for in itself , and the essential pain of the Homeric men refers to separation from that sunlight , above all in the fact that such separation is coming soon , so that people could now say of them , with a reversal of the <define> wisdom of Silenus </define> , “ The very worst thing for them was to die soon ; the second worst was to die at all . ” When the laments resound now , they tell once more of short - lived Achilles , of the changes in the race of men , transformed like leaves , of the destruction of the heroic age . It is not unworthy of the greatest hero to long to live on , even as a day labourer . Thus , in the Apollonian stage , the “ Will ” spontaneously demands to keep on living , the Homeric man feels himself so at one with living , that even his lament becomes a song of praise . \"",
